## Detecting Suicide Ideation from Social Media Posts  


### Project Description

**Research Question**: How can we better detect suicide risk? 

**Data Overview**: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed at 
link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhileswarkomati/suicide-watch 

The data are a collection of posts collected from the 'SuicideWatch' and 'teenagers' subreddits from the Reddit platform using PushshiftAPI. Posts were created between 16 December 2008 - 2 January 2021. Social media posts collected from the 'SuicideWatch' subreddit are labelled 'suicide', while posts collected from 'teenagers' are labelled 'non-suicide'

**Business Problem**: The goal of this project is to effectively predict whether an individual will subscribe to a bank term deposit or not, in order that marketing resources can be better distributed amongst and targeted towards clients more likely to subscribe.

**Data Problem**: The data task is to fit and tune multiple classification models that group individuals into subscribers vs non-subscribers. Models with high accuracy and/or recall can be used to predict the subscription status of unseen clients. Additionally, fitting regression model(s) that can be further scrutinzed for the most important features and feature values that characterize each of the two groups will indicate the profile of a subscribing client. These features will used for selecting the clients on whom resources should be focused.

### Motivation

This project is completed to fulfill the requirements of UC Berkeley's Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

### Findings

Logistic Regression + TF-IDF vectorization has the highest accuracy score, out-performing the Na√Øve Bayes and Decision Tree algorithms.
