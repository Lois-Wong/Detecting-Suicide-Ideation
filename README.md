## Detecting Suicide Ideation from Social Media Posts  


### Project Description

**Research Question**: How can we better detect suicide risk? 

**Data Overview**: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed at 
link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhileswarkomati/suicide-watch 

The data are a collection of posts collected from the 'SuicideWatch' and 'teenagers' subreddits from the Reddit platform using PushshiftAPI. Posts were created between 16 December 2008 - 2 January 2021. Social media posts collected from the 'SuicideWatch' subreddit are labelled 'suicide', while posts collected from 'teenagers' are labelled 'non-suicide'

**Business Problem**: The goal of this project is to detect suicidal ideation from social media posts by identifying the text features that most effectively predict whether a user is at risk for suicide.

**Data Problem**: The data task is to fit and tune multiple binary classification models that group social media posts into suicidal vs non-suicidal. Models with high accuracy can be used to predict, from future/unseen posts, whether their writer is at risk for suicide. Further scrutinizing the most important features and parameters which compose the best model will indicate better ways to detect suicide risk. 

### Motivation

This project is completed to fulfill the requirements of UC Berkeley's Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

### Findings

Logistic Regression + TF-IDF vectorization has the highest accuracy score, out-performing the Na√Øve Bayes and Decision Tree algorithms.
