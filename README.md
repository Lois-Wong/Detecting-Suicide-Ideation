**Goal:** The goal of this project is to identify better ways to detect people who are at risk for suicide. 

To detect suicide ideation, we will be training and tuning several binary text classification models to group social media posts into suicidal vs non-suicidal classes. Models will be able to predict, from future/unseen posts, whether their writer is at risk for suicide. We will assess model performance and further scrutinize the predictive models to find the optimal features and parameters for this classification task, then identify measures to more effectively detect suicide ideation. 


#### Rationale

+ why you should care about this report / work
+ who should care / who is this relevant for 


"There is only one really serious philosophical problem and that is suicide" -- Albert Camus 

Suicide is a leading cause of death in the US 


#### Research Question

The question this project aims to answer is what 

The problem this project tries to solve is the growing rate of suicide. A lot undetected. Stick in statistics. On prevention and detection, starting with ideation. 

What are the the best features and models/model parameters for detecting those at risk for suicide? 



#### Data Sources

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhileswarkomati/suicide-watch 

The data are a collection of posts collected from the 'SuicideWatch' and 'teenagers' subreddits from the Reddit platform using PushshiftAPI. Posts were created between 16 December 2008 - 2 January 2021. Social media posts collected from the 'SuicideWatch' subreddit are labelled 'suicide', while posts collected from 'teenagers' are labelled 'non-suicide'
